# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | We use Git to push our code to a source control. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | To create a new folder or directory yuh. |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A pseudo-class is use do define a special state of an element or function, I will likely be using :before, :after, and :hover often. |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | specificity defines what layer you're adding conditions to in coding. there are more general "1" value like span, :after and :before, then more specific "10" value div, then ids at "100", highest level of specificity, with !important taking first precedence |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | in short, if everything is important, nothing is, so either save that for emergencies or try not to use it at all|

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | The "selector" (h1 element), the "property" (color), and the "value" (rgba(225,210,33,.75)) |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | With proper design, you not only demonstrate capability and "seriousness" of a company but also "tone" and "feel" of a company. having it also be optimized for mobile or at least various screen sizes also is nearly required these days. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | a wireframe defines product heirarchy, allowing you to organize ideas and providing a rough outline |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | i think that wireframes become more valuable with larger more specific projects, but you won't know how large or specific the project may be from the get-go, so i'd think they're a good idea, especially if working with others on a project. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | the flex property defines how an object will occupy space in relation to other in-line objects. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | width, height, padding, border, and box-sizing all affect the size of a box |
