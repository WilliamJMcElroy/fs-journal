building w bootstrap
when using bootstrap, start with their code, then overwrite, it matters with flow top bottom

ROWS AND COLUMNS MUST EXIST WITHIN CONTAINER

container uses about 90% of screen
container-fluid is 100%

make columns divs

display:flex
flex-wrap:wrap

you can split a row into 12 columns

if less than 12 and you want to even its justify-content-around or another justify-content class
