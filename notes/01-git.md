# Git

html basic prompt = !
Emoji prompt = "windows+period"

copy line = shift alt (down, up)

PADDING IS INTERNAL
MARGIN IS EXTERNAL
BORDER MOSTLY WORKS LIKE PADDING BUT VISIBLE

display:flex
align-items center

let primarycolor =--(blahhhhh)

:root{
    --dark: #hexcolor
    --light: #hexpurple
}

D FLEX BOX, THEN SET WIDTHS OF EACH ITEM

day 3
building w bootstrap
when using bootstrap, start with their code, then overwrite, it matters with flow top bottom

ROWS AND COLUMNS MUST EXIST WITHIN CONTAINER

container uses about 90% of screen
container-fluid is 100%

make rows sections
make columns divs

display:flex
flex-wrap:wrap

you can split a row into 12 columns

if less than 12 and you want to even its justify-content-around or another justify-content class

"gap" instead of Justify-content around

"col-(1 through 12)" in order to set the column width

"class col 3 (color)"
{
m = margin

mt = margin top

mb = margin bottom

ms = margin start 

p = padding

ps = padding start

pe = padding end

py is padding on y axis, top bottom

px is padding on x axis, left-right

fs is font size

btn is button
btn-primary is blue
i class for image
text-danger is red tex
text-light
text-alignment
text-start moves it back to the left side
text-end moves it to the right side

object-fit contain keeps a photo in a stock size while shrinking and growing with width and height

object-position (top, start, end, bottom)

background-image creates the background as a photo

background-size: cover fills the backgroundspace

background-position moves the position of the photo

text rgba and it can change opacity

hue-rotate changes color
}

sizes = lg large, md medium, sm small

have one column with no size infix, have a base col size

class "d-none" = no display

.section.row
.col.6
row


SPAN is an inline element

JUSTIFY CONTENT IS LEFT RIGHT

ALIGN ITEMS IS UP DOWN

col-12 col-md-6 = on medium and smaller screens, on larger screens it will be 12



in display flex you can reorder by placing order-first  on the column 

order-last also works

order 1-5
